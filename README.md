# I··C··D··O··T··S (––and––lines––)

## A React (with TypeScript) Web App (Game)

> A React-based game inspired by a Codewars kata.

  - This game is for 2-7 players who will take turns selecting lines to form boxes.
  - Scoring is 1 point per box pinned.
  - Line colors have no distinction other than one is horizontal and one is vertical, and the alternating colors felt visually appealing.

The goal of this project was to convert my previous JavaScript Prototypal Inheritance CodePen to React.
I added TypeScript alongside/during the conversion (as it should be done; it's not an after-thought, it's a development tool).

## Application URLs

  - [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/KDCinfo/icdots/)
  - [CodePen Version (working demo)](https://codepen.io/KeithDC/pen/OzdoLv/)
  - [Process Flowchart](https://www.draw.io/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&layers=1&nav=1&title=icdots.xml#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1sRE6F_TaY1wr99M4WZ0dOCoF65AiMdKT%26export%3Ddownload) -- This flowchart outline depicts the primary *ICDots* process flow. It was done at about 90% project completion, was finalized in tandem with project completion, and took about a day to complete. [https://www.draw.io](@drawio rocks!)

## Tech Stack

Working on this project provided me a more in-depth look into
  - JavaScript (ES5, ES2015 (ES6))
  - React (16.2.0)
  - TypeScript (2.13.0)
  - Local component state and props

## Other Potential Enhancements
  - Save states to local storage.
  - Activate multi-game option (the code is already in place for this).
  - Enable real-time playing (2-way data binding...?)

## Tribute | Create React App with TypeScript

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with [TypeScript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript).

You can find the most recent version of the CRA guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

If installing through the [Microsoft GitHub page](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter), you'll find their install uses the same scripts imported from the same location ([wmonk/create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript)).

  `create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts`

    > In most cases bumping the react-scripts version in package.json and running npm install in this folder should be enough, but it’s good to consult the changelog for potential breaking changes.
